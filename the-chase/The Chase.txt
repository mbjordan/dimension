The Chase

This story follows two former GRS contractors as they flee from the authorities after be falsely accused of killing a U.S. Senator and selling classified information to an anti-American mufti-national corporation.

The story starts with a CEO who wants to bring America down for monetary gain, and works with a insider within the U.S. government.  They collude to murder a senator and frame the former contractors - pinning an NSA data breach on the pair.

The two did not know each other, but trust between them was gained while talking about their pasts, and remembering a mentor who taught them a way to identify a "team member".

While in GRS, they served at different times and in different locations. They also served in different branches of the military as tier 1 operators which led them to be recruited into GRS.

As the story unfolds, and as state police and the FBI are hunting them, they rely on their skills and each other to evade authorities, while also tracking down the people who are actually responsible for their alleged crimes to clear their names.

The action part of this is multiple police chases - of which they are able to evade.  All the while still able to regroup and put more puzzle pieces in place.

The final chase and the end of the story is about their deaths.  They managed to clear their names, but before the perusing authorities are aware they are innocent of the original crimes, they swerve to miss a child in the street and careen into a river off of a bridge - at which point they both die when their car collides into the river bank (no stupid explosions, just fatal impact wounds).
